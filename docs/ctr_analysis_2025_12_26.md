## Methodology

### Thompson Sampling Parameters
- Prior: Beta(1, 1) - uniform prior
- Posterior: Beta(α, β) where α = 1 + clicks, β = 1 + views - clicks
- Posterior mean: α / (α + β)
- Posterior std: sqrt(α × β / ((α + β)² × (α + β + 1)))

### Data Source
```sql
SELECT treatment_id,
       COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN interaction_type = 'VIEWED' THEN user_id END) as views,
       COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN interaction_type = 'CLICKED' THEN user_id END) as clicks
FROM `auxia-gcp.company_1950.treatment_interaction`
WHERE DATE(interaction_timestamp_micros) >= DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE(), INTERVAL 60 DAY)
GROUP BY treatment_id
```
